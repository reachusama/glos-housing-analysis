## 📂 Getting Started

### 1. Download UK Housing Data 

P.S: I am changing this to utilise optimal storage, low-cost+high-speed query using free solutions to make it easy for users.

This dashboard **does not ship with full data**. You must manually download UK Price Paid Data from the official UK Government portal:

📎 [Price Paid Data – GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads)

* Choose **CSV format**
* You can select individual months or the full historical archive [Note: App will not support full dataset.]
* This tool supports any region, but the default demo shows Gloucestershire.

Once downloaded, upload the CSV via the **"Upload dataset"** section in the Streamlit sidebar.

### 2. Run the App

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 💡 Tips for Using the Dashboard

* Use **date filters** to focus on recent or historical windows

* Read the **caption under each section** – they help explain how visuals work
* Export charts and tables from the **three-dot menu (⋮)** in any block
